# pthread-quicksort-parallel
Project from a course in parallel programming.

## The task:
Create 3 versions of an algoritm using as specific paralelisation library (in this case POSIX threads in C, library pthread.h)
1. Sequential
2. Naive parallel solution (divide task into x threads)
3. Better than naive parallel soluton - my idea was to make rudimentary implementation of a threadpool

Disclaimer: Comments are written in Slovak, they mostly describe the way the solution works for class presentation purposes.
